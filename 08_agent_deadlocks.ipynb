    "If you configure a \"Coder Agent\" prompted to write code quickly and a \"Tester Agent\" prompted to be extremely rigorous about finding edge cases, you have inadvertently designed an adversarial game. Mathematically, their individual reward functions ($R_c$ and $R_t$) are misaligned. They will quickly fall into a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium where the Coder refuses to rewrite the architecture and the Tester refuses to pass the build. Because LLMs are stateless autoregressive predictors, they will happily repeat the exact same argument for 50 API calls until your wallet is empty.To build a production-grade system, you cannot rely on the agents \"working it out.\" <i>You must engineer strict Consensus Mechanisms and Deadlock Resolution patterns at the routing layer. </i> Here are the three architectural patterns you need to implement, moving from basic software engineering fail-safes to advanced algorithmic arbitration."

    "The simplest way to prevent an infinite loop is to stop using a global max_steps counter and start using Pairwise Negotiation Budgets. <br> \n",
    "Instead of letting agents converse freely, every edge in your multi-agent graph is assigned a finite budget $B$. Every time Agent A rejects Agent B's output, $B = B - 1$. <br>\n",
    "<i> The Architecture: </i> In frameworks like AutoGen, this is partially implemented via max_consecutive_auto_reply. However, a true token budget is dynamic. If the Coder and Tester are making progress (the code diff is shrinking), the Manager dynamically increases $B$. If the code diff is identical for two turns (a detected loop), $B$ drops to 0 instantly. <br>\n",
    "<i>The Resolution: </i> When $B = 0$, a TimeoutException is thrown to the Manager. The Manager forcefully terminates the sub-task, tags it as \"Unresolved,\" and moves on, preventing the entire system from hanging."
